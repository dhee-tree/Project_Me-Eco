# What is Project Me-Eco - Frondend repo for the Me-Eco app

Project Me-Eco is an innovative, interdisciplinary and intergenerational solution. It focuses on two major issues; mental health and environmental crisis

Your Me-Eco is a piece of paper, with seeds embedded inside. It has a QR code and a mental health prompt.

One prompt example is ‘Let it go’ - this encourages you to write down any anxieties, stresses, trauma or unwanted thoughts onto your Me-Eco, plant it, let it go, and turn it into something beautiful like a wildflower.

The QR code on your Me-Eco will take to you the digital interface, which will let you know how to look after your plant. It will also share positive climate news, as well as give affordable and sustainable challenges. The digital interface will also signpost to different mental health services, and support users in understanding which service may be the best for them using friendly and accessible language for all.

# What is the Me-Ecosystem?

The Me-Ecosystem is an ecosystem of volunteers consisting of young people, professionals, experts and more! Currently, we have a range of Me-Ecosystems of people who are focusing on different areas such as Supply Chain, Digital Interface, Marketing and Social Media, and Product Research and Development.

We are also forming a Review Panel Me-Ecosystem to review Project Me-Eco during its key milestones.
